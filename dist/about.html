        <p>Hi. My name is Rob
        And I like to think of myself as a movement
        could be my ego talking now but
        I’m the entire legion
        a culture being born, one consciousness shared
        I’m the cruise abeg
        .
        
        There aren’t any limits
        so I never hear stop
        but for now
        I’ll just drop this poem with you
        it is special to me and someday I’ll tell why
        I’m grateful you listened
        Thank you.
        My favorite color is red and I’m hoping that might be yours too.</p>

        <h3>Poet</h3>
        <h6></h6>
        <p>Hi. My name is Rob
        and I love to think of myself as a poet
        maybe because my soul loves to tell stories
        but my hands remain too lazy to write so much
        .
        
        Nevertheless I pride in all the art I can create
        I dance in the glory of my several masterpieces
        longer and harder than bare chested Ohafia men with three skulls sitting on their heads
        literally with way so much vigor and better finesse.</p>

        <h3>Spoken Word Act</h3>
        <h6></h6>
        <p>Just like you I have big dreams and goals, I deserve love, peace, happiness
        I absorb all the care and attention I can get
        But hey, there are fears still
        Well let’s just say
        I probably wouldn’t be here right now in this moment
        If I ever got completely seduced
        by thoughts of giving in and giving up.</p>

        <h3>Craetive Journalist</h3>
        <h6></h6>
        <p>I consciously work towards being a good human;
        to give love selflessly and show kindness to everyone regardless
        because I’ve learnt pain isn’t engraved on anyone’s forehead
        and It’s literally impossible to know who’s really not hurting
        “The prettiest smiles hide the deepest secrets. The prettiest eyes have cried the most tears, and the kindest hearts
        have felt the most pain”.</p>
